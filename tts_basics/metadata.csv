LJ001-0001.wav | Printing  in the only sense with which we are at present concerned  differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition,,,,
LJ001-0002.wav | in being comparatively modern.,,,,
LJ001-0003.wav | For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands  by a similar process,,,,
LJ001-0004.wav | produced the block books  which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book ,,,,
LJ001-0005.wav | the invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.,,,,
LJ001-0006.wav | And it is worth mention in passing that  as an example of fine typography ,,,,
LJ001-0007.wav | the earliest book printed with movable types  the Gutenberg  or ""forty-two line Bible"" of about 1455 ",,,,
LJ001-0008.wav | has never been surpassed.,,,,
LJ001-0009.wav | Printing  then  for our purpose  may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.,,,,
LJ001-0010.wav | Now  as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress ,,,,
LJ001-0011.wav | it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form;,,,,
LJ001-0012.wav | especially as no more time is occupied  or cost incurred  in casting  setting  or printing beautiful letters,,,,
LJ001-0013.wav | than in the same operations with ugly ones.,,,,
LJ001-0014.wav | And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages  when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were ,,,,
LJ001-0015.wav | the forms of printed letters should be beautiful  and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.,,,,
LJ001-0016.wav | The Middle Ages brought calligraphy to perfection  and it was natural therefore,,,,
LJ001-0017.wav | that the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character  and they followed them very closely.,,,,
LJ001-0018.wav | The first books were printed in black letter  i.e. the letter which was a Gothic development of the ancient Roman character ,,,,
LJ001-0019.wav | and which developed more completely and satisfactorily on the side of the ""lower-case"" than the capital letters;",,,,
LJ001-0020.wav | the ""lower-case"" being in fact invented in the early Middle Ages.",,,,
LJ001-0021.wav | The earliest book printed with movable type  the aforesaid Gutenberg Bible  is printed in letters which are an exact imitation,,,,
LJ001-0052.wav | yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than Jenson's  and in fact,,,,
LJ001-0053.wav | they must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in Italy.,,,,
LJ001-0054.wav | Jenson  however  had many contemporaries who used beautiful type ,,,,
LJ001-0055.wav | some of which -- as  e.g.  that of Jacobus Rubeus or Jacques le Rouge -- is scarcely distinguishable from his.,,,,
LJ001-0056.wav | It was these great Venetian printers  together with their brethren of Rome  Milan ,,,,
LJ001-0057.wav | Parma  and one or two other cities  who produced the splendid editions of the Classics  which are one of the great glories of the printer's art ,,,,
LJ001-0058.wav | and are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch. By far ,,,,
LJ001-0059.wav | the greater part of these Italian printers  it should be mentioned  were Germans or Frenchmen  working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.,,,,
LJ001-0060.wav | It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries,,,,
LJ001-0061.wav | the Roman letter was used side by side with the Gothic.,,,,
LJ001-0062.wav | Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter ,,,,
LJ001-0063.wav | which was generally more formally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen ,,,,
LJ001-0064.wav | many of whose types  indeed  like that of the Subiaco works  are of a transitional character.,,,,
LJ001-0065.wav | This was notably the case with the early works printed at Ulm  and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.,,,,
LJ001-0066.wav | In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.,,,,
LJ001-0067.wav | In the Low Countries and Cologne  which were very fertile of printed books  Gothic was the favorite.,,,,
LJ001-0068.wav | The characteristic Dutch type  as represented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew  is very pronounced and uncompromising Gothic.,,,,
LJ001-0069.wav | This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn de Worde  Caxton's successor ,,,,
LJ001-0070.wav | and was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries  and indeed into the eighteenth.,,,,
LJ001-0071.wav | Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character  though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.,,,,
LJ001-0072.wav | After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing  especially in Germany and Italy ,,,,
LJ001-0073.wav | went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:,,,,
LJ001-0074.wav | the best  mostly French or Low-Country  was neat and clear  but without any distinction;,,,,
LJ001-0075.wav | the worst  which perhaps was the English  was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier presses;,,,,
LJ001-0076.wav | and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century  so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.,,,,
LJ001-0077.wav | In England about this time  an attempt was made (notably by Caslon  who started business in London as a type-founder in 1720),,,,
LJ001-0078.wav | to improve the letter in form.,,,,
LJ001-0079.wav | Caslon's type is clear and neat  and fairly well designed;,,,,
LJ001-0080.wav | he seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:,,,,

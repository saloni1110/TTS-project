# TTS-project
This repository contains a simple, educational Text-to-Speech (TTS) model built from scratch using PyTorch. The project demonstrates the key components of neural speech synthesis: converting text input to mel spectrograms and then reconstructing audio. It is designed for learning and experimentation.

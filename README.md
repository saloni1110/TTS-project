# TTS-project
This repository contains a simple, educational Text-to-Speech (TTS) model built from scratch using PyTorch. The project demonstrates the key components of neural speech synthesis: converting text input to mel spectrograms and then reconstructing audio. It is designed for learning and experimentation.
It is designed for learning and experimentation, making it an excellent reference for beginners entering the TTS field.

Features:
a. Minimal character-to-spectrogram neural architecture
b. Data processing scripts for text and audio preparation
c. Training pipeline with example dataset and evaluation outputs
d. Step-by-step code documentation for easy understanding
e. Ready-to-run demo and instructions

Goals:
a. Help users understand the core concepts behind neural TTS
b. Provide a hands-on, reproducible example for portfolio or academic use
c. Serve as a starting point for more advanced neural voice synthesis projects

Contents:
a. Python source code for model, training, and inference
b. Sample dataset and usage instructions
c. Detailed README with setup, usage, and results
d. Guidance on further enhancements and deployment
